A: Pushing the S-pole in causes the flux to change in the opposite sense compared to pushing the N-pole in, resulting in a deflection in the opposite direction (Lenz's Law). B: Pulling the N-pole out causes the flux linkage to decrease, which is a change in the opposite sense to pushing it in, resulting in a deflection in the opposite direction.
